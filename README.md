# TrackingNumberService
Generating A Unique Tracking Number Code

This Code Will be Having the concurrent functionality to work with a thread-safe environment.

This code will provide a very unique tracking number associated with thw Country code, local address, and unique ALPHA-NUMERIC number.

this code is using a snowflake ID generator algorithm  which is from TWITTER and widely used, 
Which actually uses the LOCK mechanism to get the concurrency handled.

It is checking for uniquness of tracking number also which is giving the answer for FAULT TOLERANCE and duplicacy also.

Thanks !
